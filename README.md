# Project Vision:
Promoting a healthy diet has become a popular topic in our society. The sociologist and government are encouraging people from different age groups to eat well, while maintaining the good calories for the body. Therefore, I want to develop an IOS application that has the automated functionalities to predict the food images, calculate the calorie consumption, and provide excellent diet advice.

CalorieTrack is an AI-powered mobile application designed to simplify calorie tracking and help users achieve their health goals. The app provides a personalized experience by calculating daily calorie allowances based on user inputs and leveraging advanced AI for meal recognition via image capture.
